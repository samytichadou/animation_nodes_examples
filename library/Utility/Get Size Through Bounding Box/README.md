# Get Size Through Bounding Box

This nodetree is a utility to get an object size using its bounding box.
It also gives the bounding box center.

To use this, 
- set the object input in Subprogram
- use the outputs of the Subprogram to create some effects

When moving or scaling the object, the viewers in Viewers category will be updated to check the nodetree is working correctly.
