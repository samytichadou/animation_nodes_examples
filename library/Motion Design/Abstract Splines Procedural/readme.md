# Abstract Splines Procedural

This template is a ready to use motion design effect creating random curve around a guides. It also allows to animate them and add some wiggle and randomness to them.

To use it, simply use the Abstract Spline Effect subprogram.
- Set the Splines Target, and Guides curve objects.
- To animate the curve, you'll have to give some animated values to the time socket of this subprogram (like a Time Info node).
- The Procedural Animation parameters allow you to make curves appear and disappear in a given time, if you don't want this effect, uncheck it and use Manual Anim Start and Manual Anim End parameters
- You can optionally use a Taper Curve object to control the thickness of the created Curves, it will override the Radius parameters of the nodetree
